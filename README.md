# Visualisation for TTL values as a basic DDoS detection strategy

This project was written in Python 3.9.0 however newer versions should also work.

### The installation guide is as follows

Open the downloaded files from GitHub and put them in a folder. Using the command line or terminal depending on your operating system, use cd to open the folder in the command line or terminal. Then run the following commands within the folder.

``` pip install matplotlib ```

``` pip install pandas ```

``` pip install numpy ```

This should install the correct libraries needed for the visualiser to be run. If these have not been installed correctly on your operating system, there are many tutorials and forum posts on how to install these. 

Now the project should be able to be run either through normal means of running Python files on the command line or terminal or through a text editor. Visual Studio Code was used to create and run the project but any text editor with a Python interpreter should run it sufficiently. The gooddatagen and baddatagen files need to be run first otherwise the visualiser will not produce any output as it will not have the CSV files required.
